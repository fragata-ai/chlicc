# chlicc: A small C compiler written in Go

chlicc is a C compiler implemented in Go programming language.
It has been derived from
[chibicc](https://github.com/rui314/chibicc/blob/main/README.md),
a beautiful small C compiler created by Rui Ueyama.

chlicc has been created by porting the original chibicc code to Go.
It aims at supporting the same functionality as the original software.

chlicc is work in progress. The code generator for x64 is not yet implemented
(but expected soon) and the command line interface is simplified.

We named the compiler following the conventions of the original
code: in "chlicc" (pronounced as _khlee see see_) "chli" means "small" in
Swiss German and "cc" stands for C compiler.
